# Drakube-Graphyon
This name evokes the image of a mythical dragon that stands at the nexus of Kubernetes management, wielding the power of GraphQL to unify and simplify the data management experience.

## Meaning
- Drakube combines "Dra-" (a nod to "dragon") and "-kube" (from "Kubernetes"), signifying a powerful and mythical creature that masterfully orchestrates the Kubernetes environment.
- Graphyon blends "GraphQL" and the suffix "-on," often used in technology to denote particles or components. It implies a foundational element that interfaces seamlessly with GraphQL to provide a common data model.

## Overview
- Easily integrates with your existing tools or any CNCF tool.
- Reduce Deployment Risk: Eliminate risk of configuration drift by declaratively configuring Kubernetes and the API Gateway within a single YAML file. Limit who can make configuration changes through Role-Based Access Controls (RBAC).
- Increase Developer Productivity: Provide a frictionless onboarding and service discovery experience to drive API consumption. Ensure developers always have access to the most up-to-date documentation with automatic updates.
- Accelerate Deployment: Automate workflows and reduce manual tasks by seamlessly integrating with leading CI/CD tools. Automatically generate configurations and publish REST, GraphQL, and gRPC services to the Raptor Dev Portal.
